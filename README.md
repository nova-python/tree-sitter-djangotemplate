# tree-sitter-djangotemplate

This is another take on a Django template grammar for [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/). See also [tree-sitter-htmldjango](https://github.com/interdependence/tree-sitter-htmldjango).

So why does this exist? In large part because I wanted to learn tree-sitter. But I also took a different approach to the nesting structure and whitespacing handling.

*As this is being developed in tandem with the Django Nova extension, I would not recommend relying on anything to remain stable yet!*
